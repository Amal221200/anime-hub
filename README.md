Anime Hub is the one place stop to find anything and everything related to anime, eg:- Information about an anime, blogs, etc.

Stack:- 
* I have developed this application using [Next JS](https://nextjs.org) with TypeScript, powered by it's app router.
* I have used [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com), an awesome, accessible, highly configurable component library powered by [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for designing this app.
* I have used [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) as a data fetching solution, used with [Next JS server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) to avoid creating unnecessary API endpoints and redundant API calling, along with that I have used [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs) for creating global stores for UI states.
* I have used PostgreSQL as my database and [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io) for connecting and querying with my database.
* Last but not the least, I have used [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for authentication service.

Cool features:-
* Infinite Loading
* Sortable search results


This is an excellent application to show my skills as a frontend engineer with the knowledge of building a fullstack application. I have used a ton of best practises and rules for building a scalable and maintainable application.
